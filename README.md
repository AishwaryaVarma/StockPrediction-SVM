SVM(Support Vector Machine) from Scratch:-

Theory:-

1. Hyperplane:-
    Seperating plane between two categories of data. The equation of the hyperplane is:-  UW + B
    U -> Unknow vector
    W -> Perpendicular vector from origin to the hyperplane
    B -> Bias variable
    
2. Support Vectors
    They are the vectors whose removal will affect the hyperplane.
    
3. Optimization modules
    i) CVXOPT
    II) LibSVM
    
    The goal of optimization is to minimize vector 'W' and maximize bias variable 'B'. This optimization problem is known as Convex problem.
