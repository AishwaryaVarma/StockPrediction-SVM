SVM(Support Vector Machine) from Scratch:-

## Theory:-

###### Hyperplane
    Seperating plane between two categories of data. The equation of the hyperplane is:-  UW + B
    U -> Unknow vector
    W -> Perpendicular vector from origin to the hyperplane
    B -> Bias variable
    
###### Support Vectors
    They are the vectors whose removal will affect the hyperplane.
    
###### Optimization modules
    i) CVXOPT
    II) LibSVM
    
    The goal of optimization is to minimize vector 'W' and maximize bias variable 'B'. This optimization problem is known as Convex problem.
